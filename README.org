#+SETUPFILE: Setup/setupFile.org
#+TITLE: Emacs code 

* What is it?

This package is a tool to quickly generate a project structure which
is [[https://orgmode.org/][OrgMode]] ready. We provide a bash script =createOrgProject.sh
PROJECTNAME= that populate the =PROJECTNAME/= directory with all the
required files.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
TODO
#+END_EXAMPLE

To use the project (template) simply add this function to your Emacs =init.el= 

#+NAME: my-project-configuration
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
(defun my-project-configuration ()
  "Find my-project-root as parent directory of the closest .dir-locals.el file, 
then load my-project-root/Setup/setupFile.el project configuration file "
  (interactive)
  (let ((enable-local-variables :all))
    (setq my-project-root (let ((d (dir-locals-find-file ".")))
			    (when d (file-name-directory (if (stringp d) d (car d))))))

    (if my-project-root
	(let ((my-project-setup-file (concat my-project-root "Setup/setupFile.el")))
	  (if (file-exists-p my-project-setup-file)
	      (load my-project-setup-file nil t t nil)
	    (error "Project %s setup file not found" my-project-setup-file)))
      (error "Project root dir not found (missing .dir-locals.el file)"))))
#+END_SRC

Its role is to found project root (the closest .dir-locals.el file)
and to load the project configuration =Setup/setupFile.el=.
